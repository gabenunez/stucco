        <p>Above <u>everything</u> else, I'm a hard-working family man.</p>
        <p>
          I've been working in the stucco industry for my entire life (since I
          was 19 years old). I've completed work on many {% if page.city %}{{
          page.city }}{% else %}Livermore{% endif %} properties over the years
          including celebrity estates, personal homes, businesses, schools, and
          government agencies.
        </p>
        <p>
          My ultimate goal when completing the job is to ensure that everything
          was done to the highest standard possible and to leave the property as
          clean as when I got there.
